# POWER-BI-PROJECT-2-
Objective:
This project involves designing a dashboard to analyze the trend of admissions into state universities. The dashboard leverages various Power BI techniques and data transformations to visualize key metrics such as total applications, university funds, and the diversity of applicants.

Use Case:
The dashboard is designed to help analyze and visualize admissions data from state universities across the USA, using a series of transformations and advanced visualizations.


Dashboard Visualizations:

Applications Analysis Dashboard:
-Total Applications by State: Line chart to track applications across states.
-Total Applications by State Geo Dashboard: Map visual for applications by state.
-Tabular Presentation of Universities and Funds: Table displaying universities with their fund allocations.
-Percentage of Applications by Race: Pie chart to show the breakdown of applications by race.

Universities Analysis Dashboard:
-Top 10 Universities by Applications: Stacked bar chart displaying the universities with the most applications.
-Top 10 Universities by Applications with and without Special Grants: Clustered column chart comparing applications with and without special grants.
-Bottom 10 Universities by Applications: Stacked bar chart for universities with the fewest applications.
-Percentage of Applications vs. Universities Fund Allocations: Line and clustered column chart showing the relationship between application percentage and funding allocations.


Technologies Used:
-Power BI for data transformation and visualizations.
-DAX for calculated columns and measures.
-Power Query Editor for data modeling and transformations.
